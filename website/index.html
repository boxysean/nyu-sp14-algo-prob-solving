  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Algorithmic Problem Solving studies the implementation and application of algorithms to a variety of problems.  Topics covered will include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>code performance analysis,</li>
    <li>parsing and formatting text,</li>
    <li>mathematics,</li>
    <li>advanced data structures,</li>
    <li>graph algorithms,</li>
    <li>dynamic programming, and</li>
    <li>computational geometry.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Evaluation is based on participation in programming contests, quizzes, and exams.</p>
  <h1>Who should take this course</h1>
  <p>Students who would like to develop their programming and algorithmic skills by having a new set of programming challenges presented to them in each class.  Basic algorithms and comfort with Java or C++ is a prerequisite.</p>
  <h1>Expectations</h1>
  <p>Students can expect to be challenged and practice understanding and implementing algorithmic ideas outside their skillset. Each class, a new set of problems will be presented to the students and they will be asked to solve the problems. The problems will then be discussed as a class, and each student is expected to contribute to the discussions.</p>

  <h1>Homework Policy</h1>
  <p>
    Codebooks are allowed for standard algorithms, but all of the
    submitted code must be your own.  Collaboration is allowed on all
    assigments except the midterm and final, but each student must
    submit his/her own code.  Programming assignments will be
    submitted through 
    <a href="http://acm.hust.edu.cn/vjudge/">Virtual
    Judge</a>.  More information will be posted here for each
    assignment.
    If you are enrolled in the course,
    please register an account on Virtual Judge with username netid_CS480S14.  If
    you are just following the course but are not enrolled, any
    username will do, but please do not suffix it with _CS480S14.
  </p>
  <h1>Programming Homework Instructions</h1>
  <p>
    Each week there will be a programming homework hosted on the
    Virtual Judge, with links given below.  As stated above, please
    register an account on <a href="http://acm.hust.edu.cn/vjudge/">Virtual
    Judge</a> with username netid_CS480S14.  Your grade will be based on
    the number of problems solved correctly.  All programs must take
    their input from standard input, and must write their output to
    standard output.  Java programs must be contained in a public
    class entitled Main.  C++ programs must have a function main, and
    Java programs must have a method main.  If you get Judging Error
    1, it means the judging queue is backed up, and you can simply
    click refresh to be rejudged.  If you get Judging Error 2, it
    means their are server-side communication errors, and your submission
    will be automatically rejudged when the communication problems are
    fixed.  The student ranking (not used to determine your HW grade)
    is determined by how quickly you submit each
    problem (measured from the start of the competition), and how many
    incorrect submissions you have made (penalized 20 minutes for each
    incorrect submission).
