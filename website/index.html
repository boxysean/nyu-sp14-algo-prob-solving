  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Algorithmic Problem Solving studies the implementation and application of algorithms to a variety of problems.  Topics covered will include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>code performance analysis,</li>
    <li>parsing and formatting text,</li>
    <li>mathematics,</li>
    <li>advanced data structures,</li>
    <li>graph algorithms,</li>
    <li>dynamic programming, and</li>
    <li>computational geometry.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Evaluation is based on participation in programming contests, quizzes, and exams.</p>
  <h1>Who should take this course</h1>
  <p>Students who would like to develop their programming and algorithmic skills by having a new set of programming challenges presented to them in each class.  Basic algorithms and comfort with Java or C++ is a prerequisite.</p>
  <h1>Expectations</h1>
  <p>Students can expect to be challenged and practice understanding and implementing algorithmic ideas outside their skillset. Each class, a new set of problems will be presented to the students and they will be asked to solve the problems. The problems will then be discussed as a class, and each student is expected to contribute to the discussions.</p>

  <h1>Homework Policy</h1>
  <p>
    Codebooks are allowed for standard algorithms, but all of the
    submitted code must be your own.  Collaboration is allowed on all
    assigments except the midterm and final, but each student must
    submit his/her own code.  Programming assignments will be
    submitted through 
    <a href="http://acm.hust.edu.cn/vjudge/">Virtual
    Judge</a>.  More information will be posted here for each
    assignment.
    If you are enrolled in the course,
    please register an account on Virtual Judge with username netid_CS480S14.  If
    you are just following the course but are not enrolled, any
    username will do, but please do not suffix it with _CS480S14.
  </p>
  <h1>Programming Homework Instructions</h1>
  <p>
    Each week there will be a programming homework hosted on the
    Virtual Judge, with links given below.  As stated above, please
    register an account on <a href="http://acm.hust.edu.cn/vjudge/">Virtual
    Judge</a> with username netid_CS480S14.  Your grade will be based on
    the number of problems solved correctly.  All programs must take
    their input from standard input, and must write their output to
    standard output.  Java programs must be contained in a public
    class entitled Main, and they must be in the default package. 
    C++ programs must have a function main, and
    Java programs must have a method main.  If you get Judging Error
    1, it means the judging queue is backed up, and you can simply
    click refresh to be rejudged.  If you get Judging Error 2, it
    means their are server-side communication errors, and your submission
    should be automatically rejudged when the communication problems are
    fixed.  On Judging Error 2, if you see other people getting
    submissions through, you may want to resubmit.
    The student ranking (not used to determine your HW grade)
    is determined by how quickly you submit each
    problem (measured from the start of the competition), and how many
    incorrect submissions you have made (penalized 20 minutes for each
    incorrect submission).

      <p>Hints:
      <ol>
	<li>The 3n+1 Problem: Be careful not to make any added assumptions about the
	  two input integers.
	  Additional <a href="./ProgHW1/UVA00100Test2.in">sample
	  input</a> and <a href="./ProgHW1/UVA00100Test2.out">sample output</a>.</li>
	<li>Polly The Polynomial: Time bounds are very tight on this
	problem.  Make sure to use the efficient I/O methods discussed
	in class, and compute the polynomial values effciently
	(<a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Horner's_rule_for_polynomial_evaluation">
	Horner's Rule</a>).  32-bit integer arithmetic is fine for
	this problem. </li>
	<li> Newspaper: This problem has a lot of input, and uses
	extended ASCII, so use efficient I/O methods and remember the
	comment I made in class (about extended ASCII). Fixed the
	problem statement: there should be no space before the output.</li>
	<li> I Can Guess The Data Structure: This problem has a lot of
	input and output, so code accordingly. </li>
	<li> Easy Problem from Rujia Liu?: A lot of input and output, so be
	careful. Requires a good way to store the data given.</li>

	  <li> Diving for Gold: Knapsack Problem. </li>
	  <li> Garbage Heap: Use 64-bit integers for everything.  Can
	  get a O(n^5) algorithm by looping over all possible

	  dimension. </li>
	  <li> Chest of Drawers: Potential state for DP/memo could be (is

	  <li>Battleships: Count the connected components that aren't
	  sunk.  Remember ships cannot touch. </li>
	  <li>Ordering Tasks: Topological sort. </li>
	  <li>Unlock the Lock: Breadth first search over the
	  graph of reachable lock states. </li>
	  <li>Place the Guards: Try to 2-color each component.
	  Remember that each vertex must be guarded, so a component
	  with 1 vertex needs a guard. <a href="./ProgHW6/UVA11080Test2.in"> Additional

	Programming Homework 7</a> (graded out of 6).
      Hints (difficulties from 1 to 10):
      <ol>
	<li> Dark Roads (diff=4): Straightforward application of Kruskal's
	algorithm. </li>
	<li> Lift Hopping (diff=7): Run Dijkstra on the graph of
	  (elevator,floor) pairs.  The queue is initialized with all
	  pairs of the form (e,0) where elevator e can go to floor
	  0. </li>
	<li> Traffic (diff=6): Use Bellman Ford and note that the edge weights
	  are the differences in busyness cubed.  Correction to 
	  problem statement: There may be multiple blank lines between
	  each input test case.  Also, make sure to output '?' if the
	  cost is less than 3 or if the node is unreachable (negative
	  infinity is less than 3 in case of a negative cycle).

	<li> Commandos (diff=5): After running all pairs shortest path, the
	  answer can be computed quickly. </li>
	<li> Inspector's Dilemma (diff=6): For each connected component, count
	  the number of odd degree nodes, and use what we learned
	  about Eulerian graphs.

	</li>
	<li> Checkers (diff=5): Standard DP on a graph.  Just count the number
	  of paths using memoization. </li>
	<li> Arbitrage (diff=8): Slightly trickier Bellman Ford.  Test for
	values above 1.1+1e-9 to avoid precision errors. </li>
	<li> Ants Colony (diff=9): Requires a highly tuned implementation of
	  Tarjan's LCA algorithm (the union-find DFS one).  Don't
	  reallocate any data structures unnecessarily, or 
	  use any hashing. </li>
